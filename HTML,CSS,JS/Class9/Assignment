Object: Not a primitive data type, as objects are complex data structures.
Array: Not a primitive data type, as arrays are specialized objects.
Number: A primitive data type representing numeric values.
Function: Not a primitive data type, as functions are objects in JavaScript.

What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?

Choose the correct answer from below:
Your score for this problem will be decided based on your FIRST SUBMISSION ONLY
The period of time during which a variable is being hoisted.
The period of time during which a variable is being assigned a value.
The period of time during which a variable cannot be accessed due to being in an unintialized state.
The period of time during which a variable cannot be accessed due to being out of scope.

The correct answer is:

The period of time during which a variable cannot be accessed due to being in an uninitialized state.

Explanation:
- The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the period between the creation of a variable and its initialization with a value.
- During this period, attempting to access the variable will result in a ReferenceError, as the variable exists but has not been assigned a value yet.
- Once the variable is initialized, it exits the TDZ, and its value can be accessed normally.
- This mechanism is a safeguard in JavaScript to catch potential errors related to accessing variables before they are properly initialized.
